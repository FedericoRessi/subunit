  CHANGES:

  IMPROVEMENTS:

  BUG FIXES:

  API CHANGES:

    * When a time: directive is encountered in a subunit stream, the python
      bindings now call the ``time(seconds)`` method on ``TestResult``.

  INTERNALS:

    * (python) Added ``subunit.test_results.AutoTimingTestResultDecorator``. Most
      users of subunit will want to wrap their ``TestProtocolClient`` objects
      in this decorator to get test timing data for performance analysis.

    * (python) ExecTestCase supports passing arguments to test scripts.

    * (python) New helper ``subunit.test_results.HookedTestResultDecorator``
      which can be used to call some code on every event, without having to
      implement all the event methods.

    * (python) ``TestProtocolClient.time(a_datetime)`` has been added which
      causes a timestamp to be output to the stream.
