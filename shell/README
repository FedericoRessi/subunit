This tree contains shell bindings to the subunit protocol. They are written 
entirely in shell, and unit tested in shell. See the tests/ directory for the
test scripts. You can use `make check` to run the tests. There is a trivial
python test_shell.py which uses the pyunit gui to expose the test results in a
compact form.
